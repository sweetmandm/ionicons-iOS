# IonIcons-iOS
Easily use IonIcons in your iOS projects

*Currently using ionicons 2.0*

### Usage:

For available icons, look at ionicons-codes.h or [browse them at the IonIcons website](http://ionicons.com).

Get the IonIcons font:

    UIFont *ionIconsFont = [IonIcons fontWithSize:30.0f];

Make a UILabel with a IonIcons Icon:

    UILabel *label = [IonIcons labelWithIcon:icon_ionic size:20.0f color:[UIColor blackColor]];

Render a IonIcons icon in a UIImage:

        UIImage *icon = [IonIcons imageWithIcon:icon_ionic
                                      iconColor:[UIColor redColor]
                                       iconSize:60.0f
                                      imageSize:CGSizeMake(90.0f, 90.0f)];


### Installation Step 1:

CocoaPods is great:

1. add `pod 'IonIcons'` to your Podfile
2. `pod install`
3. open the xcworkspace
4. Modify your project's Info.plist file as described below

Non-CocoaPods is easy too:

1. Drag the folder 'ionicons' with the source files into your project
2. Modify your project's Info.plist file as described below

### Installation Step 2:

Modify your project's Info.plist file:

1. Open your project's Info.plist file by clicking on the project in the Navigator on the left, then choosing 'Info'.
2. Under 'Custom iOS Target Properties', click the last Key in the list, then click on the '+' icon.
3. For the new key, type 'Fonts provided by application'.
4. Twirl down the arrow icon, double-tap the right-most box to enter the string value, and type 'ionicons.ttf'.
